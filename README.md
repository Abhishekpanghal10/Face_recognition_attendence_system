About The Project
Face Recognition based Attendance System
Face recognition based Attendance System can be used to mark the attendance of employees or students using face recognition so we no longer need to mark the attendance manually. Once registration of the students is done in the database, it becomes very easy to take attendance. One only needs to use the facial recognition feature to mark the attendance and simply export the attendance csv file. This can further be used to evaluate the attendance of the students. Also, this system can be used even in corporates and offices to mark the attendance of the employees using face recognition.
